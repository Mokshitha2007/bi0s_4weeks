**BLOCKCHAIN**


- **Bitcoin** was one of the first to use **blockchain technology**.  
- It was introduced in the **Bitcoin Whitepaper** by **Satoshi Nakamoto** (a pseudonym).  
- Bitcoin allows **peer-to-peer transactions** without needing a middleman.  
- It uses **cryptography** to secure transactions.  
- It enables **censorship-resistant finance** (no one can block or control it).  
- Bitcoin is considered **"digital gold"** because of its **fixed supply**.  
- Like **gold**, Bitcoin is **scarce** and valuable.



**Cryptography** is the practice of securing information by converting it into a secret code. It helps protect data from being accessed or altered by unauthorized people.  

### **Key Concepts of Cryptography:**  
- **Encryption** – Converts plain text into unreadable code.  
- **Decryption** – Converts encrypted data back to readable text.  
- **Hashing** – Creates a fixed-size fingerprint (hash) of data.  
- **Keys** – Secret codes used for encryption and decryption.  

Cryptography is used in **banking, passwords, blockchain, and secure communication** (like WhatsApp or Bitcoin transactions).
