### 🔹 **Topic:** Understanding Centralized Networks (Foundation for Blockchain)

This is an introductory explanation to help learners grasp the concept of **centralized networks**, which is the foundation for understanding **blockchain and decentralization**.

---

### ✅ **What is a Centralized Network?**

* A **centralized network** consists of:

  * A **central server** (main control point)
  * Multiple **nodes** (devices like phones, laptops, etc.) connected to this server
* This is the structure that powers **most of the apps and systems we use today**—about **99% of all networks**.

### 🍔 **Example: Swiggy – A Centralized Food Delivery App**

To explain the concept better, Swiggy is used as a real-world example:

#### Key Elements:

1. **Swiggy's Server** – the central system that controls everything.
2. **Restaurants** – like Domino’s, McDonald’s, KFC – connect their menus to the server.
3. **Customers** – people like us – connect through the Swiggy app to place orders.

#### How it Works:

* **Anushka** (a user) opens the Swiggy app.
* She orders a **₹500 burger** from **Domino’s**.
* The app sends this request to the **Swiggy server**.
* The server processes the order and informs Domino’s.
* The burger is prepared and delivered to Anushka.

### ⚙️ **Key Characteristics of Centralized Systems:**

* Everything is **controlled by a central authority** (like Swiggy).
* All communication **passes through the central server**.
* If the server fails or is hacked, the **entire system can break down**.
* The **central server holds all the power and data**.

---

### 💡 **Why is this Important?**

Understanding how centralized systems work sets the stage for:

* Learning how **decentralized systems** differ.
* Understanding the **problems centralized systems have** (like lack of transparency, risk of failure, central control).
* Leading into **why blockchain and Bitcoin were created**—to solve these issues.
